RC3432's Random Traits adds random feats and flaws to spice up your character.
Choosen by random upon creation or death of a medium core player, the intention is to make every player as unique as possible while not going too far to the overpowered or weak side.
It comes with a configuration to choose the amount of feats or flaws you want.
The best option for a regular playthrough is 2 Feats and 1 Flaw
(This mod is still experimental. Bugs are still a posibility)

!!! Make sure you customize the config before starting a new character !!!

The following (Current) Feats are listed here:

- Athletic: Improves your characters strength, which allows you to do athletic feats such as swimming or climbing.
- Acrobatic: Massively increases your mobility and allows you to do dashes and double jumps.
- Fisherman: Increased fishing power and ability to see what you caught.
- Hardy: +4 defense and life regeneration.
- Intellegent: Being one of great intellegence, magic and important information comes to you easily.
- Stealthy: Allows you to avoid enemies and other players are more likely to be targeted than you are.
- Persuasive: All items you buy from NPCs cost 20% less.
- Perceptive: Improves vision and eyesight, allowing you to better see in the dark and become immune to darkness and blackout. It also allows you to see much further.

The following (Current) Flaws are listed here:

- Clumsy: Reduces your mobility by 20% (Immune if you have the Acrobatic Trait)
- Impaired Vision: Reduces your visibility and makes you immune to sight potions. (Immune if you have the Perceptive Trait) 
- Deaf: Turns off all sounds in the world (Can be turned off in config if found annoying)
- Feeble: Weakens your melee effectiveness and increases damage taken. (Immune if you have the Athletic Trait)
- Aggressive: Reduces all defense by 4 and slightly increases all damage. (Immune if you currently have the Calming buff)
